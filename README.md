Hi,

This is a Test Project called ContentDistributionApp.

Technologies:
Net8 API
GraphQL
Redis

How to Run:
This solution has a docker compose that will run the entirety of the solution in one network.
Redis is hosted on a docker container as well, and it communicates with the Net Application together.

If you want to use a separate Redis, I suggest to modify the appsettings to connect redis there.

Happy Running!
